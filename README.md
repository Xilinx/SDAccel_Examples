SDAccel Example Repository
===========================

Welcome to the SDAccel example repository. This repository contains the latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting Xilinx PCIe FPGA acceleration boards. All examples are ready to be compiled and executed on boards hosted in the Nimbix and IBM SuperVessel clouds. The repository is organized as follows:

1. GETTINGS STARTED
2. ACCELERATION
3. SECURITY
4. VISION
5. LIBS
6. UTILITY
7. OTHER INFORMATION
8. SUPPORT
9. REVISION HISTORY


## 1. GETTING STARTED

Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use different features of SDAccel and start on their own application. 

## 2. ACCELERATION

Collection of examples in processor offloading to FPGA based compute units.

## 3. SECURITY

Collection of examples in encryption and data security. 

## 4. VISION

Collection of examples in image and video processing. 

## 5. LIBS

Collection of common libraries used across all examples to assist in the quick development of application host code. 

## 6. UTILITY

Collection of utility functions used as part of the Makefiles in all of the examples. This set includes Makefile rules and scripts to launch SDAccel compiled applications onto boards hosted by Nimbix directly from the developers terminal shell.
